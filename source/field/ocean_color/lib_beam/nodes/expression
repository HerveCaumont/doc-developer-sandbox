Node expression
===============

As the first job in this workflow, the expression processing step:
* defines the parameters to query the catalogue which, in this case is the start and end time (time of interest) of the MERIS Level 1 products.
* invokes the ESA BEAM Toolbox BandMaths Operator to apply the provided band arithmetic expression to all products covering the time of interest 
* publishes the results in a distributed file system
